# create-sapper-app

## usage

Installs https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template into the specified folder

```bash
$ yarn create sapper-app my-sapper-app # uses rollup by default
$ yarn create sapper-app --webpack my-sapper-app # use webpack
```

## Why?

yarn has a built-in CLI command for which you don't have the remember a github repo,
or npx, or degit. If you're more used to those tools use those. If you're more familiar
with `yarn create *` use this CLI.
